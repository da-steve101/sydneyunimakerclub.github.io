Makerspace: The Sydney Invention Studio
===========
<!-- With partnership with the Sydney Invention Studio, on the ground floor of the Link Building in the engineering campus, the space is open to students to hack their own projects and use the Studio's resources and services under their [policy and guidelines][needs to be some documentation]. Services which the Studio provides at cost price are:

* 3D Printing 
  * Deposition Printer
  * Filament -->
* More to come...

Workshops 
=========
Great for anyone trying to pick up something without the time to look-up for yourself. The workshops are run by senior mentor members who come from a range of background experiences, including PhD students, alumni, tutors, from various schools and faculties. See our *[workshops](/workshops)* page for details into our upcoming workshops.

Kit Lending
===========
Like libraries lend out books, for a full-refundable deposit, you can borrow our Arduino kits for you to play and tinker with at home in your own time. 


Weekly Meetups
==============
Always wanted to get started on a project, but don't know who to bounce your ideas off? Perhaps you're already working on something but just need that space to work in and gather some feedback. Our weekly meetups are held in the Sydney Invention Studio once a week, to chill, socialise, and use time for

Backed Group Project
===============
What makes it easy to learn new skills is to have a project in mind to think about. The club looks for a range of sponsors and backers for project proposals that run, and are constantly looking for people to team together and back these projects themselves. See our [Projects](/projects) page to see what current projects are backed, looking for team members, or are looking for backers.

Future Projects and Community Outreach
======================================
In addition to running our own projects, as part of the culture of making, we endorse the consolidation and sharing to others, including the improvement to STEM learning in schools.
