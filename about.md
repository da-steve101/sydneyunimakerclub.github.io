We're a student run society that aim to recognise and foster informal projects for students
  who want to expand their creativity in hands-on projects. We facilitate workshops and workspaces for members aswell as group projects to get them started on their next best new innovation.

Starting in February 2015, the Maker Club was developed and aimed to foster the development of design and creative projects through a social space on campus. 

We fund ourselves through donations and project sponsors to make such resources affordable for our student members.
