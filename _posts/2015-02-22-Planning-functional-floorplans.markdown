Thinking about how to work in the most free-flowing environment can be tricky. Nothing screams of creativity more than when you walk into a full-stocked organised workshop that makes your eyes-widen, jaw drop, and drool like you were a kid in a candy shop. Of course when there's budget limitations, and size constraints, there's going to be quite a bit of thinking involved. But never did we imagine how much research it would involve.

Sparkfun's Creative Technologist, N*** Poole (I'll leave the first name for you to guess), wrote up a three-part blog series ([Part I][1], [Part I][2], and [Part III][3]) into designing his new rapid prototyping space in the SparkFun's newly located premises.

What really strikes with his design is going for modularity and re-configurability. Which is how we've got ourselves thinking of workbenches with wheels (and brakes of course). We're so in love with the castor-mounted butchers block workbench he used (matching the logo and all) that we were saddened to hear that its supplier, Global Industrial, doesn't have any warehouses outside the US- leaving us with a no-go option of paying for large import tax. 

Of course as we explore into the beginnings of this club, we'll start to better focus what we need and don't need. But one thing we would ultimately like to achieve is that candyshop effect any maker would so desire. Mmmm.. Candy...
