We're coming up to another semester, and we're excited to be getting the club up and running and signing up new members for our first year! We will be found at the Engineering O-Day (__WED 25th Feb__) lawns, on Darlington Campus during O-week. Note, because we aren't affiliated with USU ~~~yet~~~ , we won't be able to be with the other clubs in Eastern Avenue this year. Neverthe less __[sign up to our mailing-list][mailing-list]__ to keep track of our news and the details on our Inaugral General Meeting as an incorporated association.
