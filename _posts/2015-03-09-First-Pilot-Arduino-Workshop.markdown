We have our first pilot introductory workshop on Arduino Programming the day before the IGM for those who are keen on getting hands on straight away. This will be open to ALL students for FREE. So bring along your friends and get yourselves started on some basic fundamentals.

No prior knowledge of programming is assumed! Also find this an opportunity to come along and checkout the space we'll have available as our makerspace starts to develop.

*Required: Due to the limited resources of the venue, attendees are required too bring a laptop. Having the [Arduino software](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software) installed prior is also strongly encouraged.*
