Have an idea?
=============

To propose a project we will have a board of <b>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</b>. Any member can write up a brief idea on the board to see if there is any interest in the club. You (The Project Master) should provide contact details (name/phone/email). Anyone interested can write down their name under the project and contact the project master. The project manager can also type up a description to put on our site here :)
