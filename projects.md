Have an idea?
=============

To propose a project we will have a board of <b>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</b>. Any member can write up a brief idea on the board to see if there is any interest in the club. You (The Project Master) should provide contact details (name/phone/email). Anyone interested can write down their name under the project and contact the project master. The project manager can also type up a description to put on our site here :)

Some Possible Projects
=====================

<b>Student Feeding device - Project Master: Stephen Tridgell</b>

Everyone loves pancakes! Lets make something to make them for us. The END!!!

<b>Makerclub site dev - Project Master: Calla Klafas</b>

We have a website who wants to help make it better?

<b>Kayak to the gong - Project Master: Stephen Tridgell</b>

A. Prof. Philip Leong would like to send a kayak from sydney harbour to wollengong by itself! This project would possibly be funded by the uni.
