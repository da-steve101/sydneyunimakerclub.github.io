Have an idea?
=============

To propose a project we will have a board of <b>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</b>. Any member can write up a brief idea on the board to see if there is any interest in the club. You (The Project Master) should provide contact details (name/phone/email). Anyone interested can write down their name under the project and contact the project master. Alternatively, <a href="https://groups.google.com/">create a group on google</a> and put the link up here like the ones below. The project manager can also type up a description to put on our site :)

How a project works in the Maker Club
=====================================

Each project must find its own funding. The purpose of the Maker Club in regards to projects is to assist and facilitate the projects. We will try to put you in contact with people who may be interested in funding your project. The project can optionally have an account with the Maker Club. This is so you can store the funds in our bank account and so you don't have to jump through all the hoops of having your own.

Inducted members will have access to the lab and equipment <a href="/membership">(see membership page)</a>. We hope this is useful for your project! If you would like to add your project to this page, the source is at <a href="https://github.com/sydneyunimakerclub/sydneyunimakerclub.github.io">github</a>. Follow these instructions to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork the repo</a> then edit this file (projects.md), push your changes then <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">create a pull request</a>.
